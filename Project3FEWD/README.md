Game funtion:

The came allow for use of multiple payers chosen at start of game by entering first letter of name otherwise the default will be iused

I added a 4th brick for more playing options and took away 1 of the grass

The game keeps the player on the board allowing the player to move up, down left and right with the arrow keys

the object is to have the player cross the stone road to the water and not be hit by the bugs, if the player is struck returns to the starting point

for every time the player makes it to the water the player is reset and and another bug appears makeing it more difficult and rasing the level

The game starts at level 1 w/ 3 bugs and for time the palyer gets to the water the console logs the level

Once the player is hit by a bug it resets to level 1 and 3 bugs

the goal is to get tot he highest level
